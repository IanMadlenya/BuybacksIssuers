The paper is generated by sourcing file **bb_issuers.Rnw**. Please start from that time to trace the paths to the code files used. 

In order to generate the paper (and source the file bb_issuers.Rnw) you need to first generate all data based on the raw data from [WRDS](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu). As we cannot make the WRDS data public (e.g. from CRSP, [Thomson/Reuters SDC](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/financial/market-data/sdc-platinum.html),  and other data sources), it is not possible to generate the pdf report after only downloading/forking all files. However, all details about how the data is generated is described in the [dataset/Documentation](https://github.com/tevgeniou/BuybacksIssuers/tree/master/dataset/Documentation) directory, in [Dataset Creation Readme](https://github.com/tevgeniou/BuybacksIssuers/blob/master/dataset/Documentation/README.Rmd) - also the pdf version [Readme.pdf](https://github.com/tevgeniou/BuybacksIssuers/blob/master/dataset/Documentation/README.pdf). 

All sub-directories in the dataset directory are left empty to indicate the structure of the data as described in dataset/Documentation.
