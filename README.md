The paper is generated by sourcing file **bb_issuers.Rnw**. Please start from that file to trace the paths to all code files used. 

In order to generate the paper (and source the file bb_issuers.Rnw) you need to first generate all data based on the raw data from [WRDS](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu). As we cannot make the WRDS data public (e.g. from CRSP, [Thomson/Reuters SDC](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/financial/market-data/sdc-platinum.html),  and other data sources), it is not possible to generate the pdf report after only downloading/forking all files in this repository - at this stage. However, all details about how the data is generated is described in **the [Dataset Creation Readme](https://github.com/tevgeniou/BuybacksIssuers/blob/master/dataset/Documentation/Readme.Rmd) - it is important to read that file first** (all sub-directories in the dataset directory are left empty to indicate the structure of the data as described in the dataset creation Documentation). 

An interactive tool to explore paper parameters that also allows the creation and download of customized versions of the paper (along the lines of [this example](https://inseaddataanalytics.shinyapps.io/ExerciseSet23/)) will be available soon.
